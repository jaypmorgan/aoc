;; --- Day 7: No Space Left On Device ---

;; You can hear birds chirping and raindrops hitting leaves as the
;; expedition proceeds. Occasionally, you can even hear much louder
;; sounds in the distance; how big do the animals get out here,
;; anyway?

;; The device the Elves gave you has problems with more than just its
;; communication system. You try to run a system update:

;; $ system-update --please --pretty-please-with-sugar-on-top
;; Error: No space left on device

;; Perhaps you can delete some files to make space for the update?

;; You browse around the filesystem to assess the situation and save
;; the resulting terminal output (your puzzle input). For example:

;; $ cd /
;; $ ls
;; dir a
;; 14848514 b.txt
;; 8504156 c.dat
;; dir d
;; $ cd a
;; $ ls
;; dir e
;; 29116 f
;; 2557 g
;; 62596 h.lst
;; $ cd e
;; $ ls
;; 584 i
;; $ cd ..
;; $ cd ..
;; $ cd d
;; $ ls
;; 4060174 j
;; 8033020 d.log
;; 5626152 d.ext
;; 7214296 k

;; The filesystem consists of a tree of files (plain data) and
;; directories (which can contain other directories or files). The
;; outermost directory is called /. You can navigate around the
;; filesystem, moving into or out of directories and listing the
;; contents of the directory you're currently in.

;; Within the terminal output, lines that begin with $ are commands
;; you executed, very much like some modern computers:

;; - cd means change directory. This changes which directory is the
;; current directory, but the specific result depends on the argument:
;; - cd x moves in one level: it looks in the current directory for
;; the directory named x and makes it the current directory.
;; - cd .. moves out one level: it finds the directory that contains
;; the current directory, then makes that directory the current
;; directory.
;; - cd / switches the current directory to the outermost directory,
;; /.
;; - ls means list. It prints out all of the files and directories
;; immediately contained by the current directory:
;; - 123 abc means that the current directory contains a file named
;; abc with size 123.
;; - dir xyz means that the current directory contains a directory
;; named xyz.
;; - Given the commands and output in the example above, you can
;; determine that the filesystem looks visually like this:

;; - / (dir)
;;   - a (dir)
;;     - e (dir)
;;       - i (file, size=584)
;;     - f (file, size=29116)
;;     - g (file, size=2557)
;;     - h.lst (file, size=62596)
;;   - b.txt (file, size=14848514)
;;   - c.dat (file, size=8504156)
;;   - d (dir)
;;     - j (file, size=4060174)
;;     - d.log (file, size=8033020)
;;     - d.ext (file, size=5626152)
;;     - k (file, size=7214296)

;; Here, there are four directories: / (the outermost directory), a
;; and d (which are in /), and e (which is in a). These directories
;; also contain files of various sizes.

;; Since the disk is full, your first step should probably be to find
;; directories that are good candidates for deletion. To do this, you
;; need to determine the total size of each directory. The total size
;; of a directory is the sum of the sizes of the files it contains,
;; directly or indirectly. (Directories themselves do not count as
;; having any intrinsic size.)

;; The total sizes of the directories above can be found as follows:

;; - The total size of directory e is 584 because it contains a single
;; file i of size 584 and no other directories.
;; - The directory a has total size 94853 because it contains files f
;; (size 29116), g (size 2557), and h.lst (size 62596), plus file i
;; indirectly (a contains e which contains i).
;; - Directory d has total size 24933642.
;; - As the outermost directory, / contains every file. Its total size
;; is 48381165, the sum of the size of every file.
;; - To begin, find all of the directories with a total size of at
;; most 100000, then calculate the sum of their total sizes. In the
;; example above, these directories are a and e; the sum of their
;; total sizes is 95437 (94853 + 584). (As in this example, this
;; process can count files more than once!)
;; - Find all of the directories with a total size of at most
;; 100000. What is the sum of the total sizes of those directories?
